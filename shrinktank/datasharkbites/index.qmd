## Sharpen Your dplyr Skills: The slice() Function

Ever needed to grab specific rows from your data frame? The `slice()` function from dplyr is your go-to tool!

```r
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])

# Get the first 5 rows
df %>% slice(1:5)

# Get every other row
df %>% slice(seq(1, n(), by = 2))

# Get the last 3 rows
df %>% slice(tail(n():1, 3))
```

Remember: Like a shark's precision bite, `slice()` lets you extract exactly the rows you need!
