# Key Fixes:

1. **Directory Index Files**: Created proper index.qmd files for each directory that:
   - Serve as category landing pages
   - Point to the specific .qmd files in their directories
   - Include listing configurations with explicit file paths

2. **Fixed Gallery Listing**:
   - Changed pattern to `"../emotional-journeys/*.qmd"` and `"../user-stories/*.qmd"`
   - Uses relative paths to access files in sibling directories

3. **Corrected Shrink Tank Listing**:
   - Now points to directory index files instead of direct .qmd files
   - Example: `"emotional-journeys/index.qmd"` instead of `"emotional-journeys/*.qmd"`

4. **Created Missing start-session.qmd**:
   - Resolves the "Unable to resolve link target" warning
   - Provides the microphone interface for starting sessions

5. **Stable Listing Patterns**:
   - Uses explicit file paths instead of wildcards where possible
   - When using wildcards, ensures they point to existing directories

This structure creates a clear hierarchy where each directory has:
1. An index.qmd that serves as the category landing page
2. Points to specific content files in its directory
3. Provides proper navigation anchors for Quarto

The gallery now pulls content from emotional-journeys and user-stories directories, which should resolve the "doesn't match any files" error since those directories contain valid .qmd files.
