## What You'll Learn

1. 🦈 **The Data Science Lifecycle**: Understand the steps from data collection to insights
2. 🐠 **Data Wrangling with R**: Clean and prepare data like a pro
3. 🐋 **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Uncover hidden patterns in your data
4. 🦑 **Statistical Thinking**: Make sense of complex datasets
5. 🐬 **Introduction to Machine Learning**: Dive into predictive modeling
6. 🐙 **Data Visualization**: Create compelling visual stories with your data

## Course Structure

- 6 modules, each focusing on a key area of data science
- Hands-on exercises and projects using real-world datasets
- Weekly DataSharkBites for quick, focused learning
- Interactive coding sessions with our shark-tastic instructors

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (any language)
- Familiarity with high school level mathematics
- A curiosity for data and a appetite for learning!

## Sample Lesson: Introduction to Data Wrangling with R

Let's take a quick bite into data wrangling with R using the `dplyr` package:

```r
library(dplyr)

# Sample dataset: Ocean temperature readings
ocean_temp <- data.frame(
  date = as.Date('2023-01-01') + 0:9,
  temp_celsius = c(20, 21, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 19, 20, 21),
  location = rep(c("Reef", "Open Water"), each = 5)
)

# Let's do some data wrangling!
ocean_temp %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_temp = mean(temp_celsius),
    max_temp = max(temp_celsius),
    min_temp = min(temp_celsius)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_temp))
```

In this snippet, we're analyzing ocean temperatures, grouping by location, and calculating summary statistics. This is just a taste of what you'll learn in our data wrangling module!
