Today I spoke with the AI therapist about my constant anxiety. I described the feeling of being trapped in my own thoughts. 

The therapist guided me to:
- Identify specific anxiety triggers
- Recall moments of courage
- Visualize a calmer state

The resulting song, "Calm Within the Storm," surprised me. The chorus especially resonated:

> "I am stronger than the fear  
> The storm will pass, the sky will clear  
> This anxious weight will lift in time  
> My strength is real, and it is mine"

Hearing my own emotions reflected back in music made me realize how much inner strength I actually have, even when I feel overwhelmed.
